# withTheme

Injects the theme object, that is passed down using a [ThemeProvider](ThemeProvider.md), into a component's props.
It will automatically rerender the component if the theme changes. This even works if any parent component implements `shouldComponentUpdate`.

## Imports

```javascript nocopy
import { withTheme } from 'react-fela'
import { withTheme } from 'preact-fela'
import { withTheme } from 'inferno-fela'
```

## Example

```javascript
const Component = ({ theme }) => <div>The primary color is {theme.primary}</div>

const ComponentWithTheme = withTheme(Component)
```

## Tips & Tricks

- If components were accessing theme object directly via context before, this would not be possible since 6.0 release. You would have to wrap the component with _withTheme_ Hoc and access the theme via props.
- Another way to access theme inside a custom component would be to pass in the component to createComponent and access theme object via props.
