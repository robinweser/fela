# Usage with Inferno

Inferno is a modern React-like UI library which ships an almost identical API, but claims to be much faster.
Due to the fact it is really similar to React's API, the [Inferno bindings for Fela](https://github.com/robinweser/fela/tree/master/packages/inferno-fela) are basically the same as the [React bindings for Fela](https://github.com/robinweser/fela/tree/master/packages/react-fela).

```bash
yarn add inferno-fela
```

Instead of providing duplicate documentation, we therefore want you to check out the [Usage with React](UsageWithReact.md) instead. Just "replace" React with Inferno and you should be fine. There are only some differences which we are listing below.

> **Note**: Similar to the usage guide, the API reference for react-fela works identical with preact-fela.
