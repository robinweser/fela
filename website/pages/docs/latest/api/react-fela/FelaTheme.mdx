# FelaTheme

> **Note**: If you're working with React > 16.3, we **highly recommend** using the [useFela](api/react-fela/useFela) hook instead.<br />It's more easy and safe to use and also has the best rendering performance.
> FelaTheme is an alternative component to the [withTheme](api/react-fela/withTheme)-HoC leveraging the render-props pattern. It is used to access the theme object that is specified and passed down via React's [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) APIs by a [ThemeProvider](api/react-fela/ThemeProvider).
