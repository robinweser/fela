# Caveats

Like every solution, also Fela is not **the** ultimate solution and should not be blindly used without evaluating its benefits and disadvantages. The strict design decisions also have some caveats.

## Computed Selectors

The unique computed selectors are quite handy as they [prevent namespacing conflicts](intro/benefits#local-namespace). But they are not designed to be human-readable nor to be mutated at all. <br />
However, if you need to mutate the styles from outside, consider providing an API to pass the props.

## Shorthand & Longhand Properties

Probably the biggest downside of using atomic CSS design, is the fact that shorthand and longhand properties can't safely be mixed in a single rule.

```javascript nocopy
const rule = (props) => ({
  border: '1px solid black',
  borderColor: 'red',
})
```

The above example will not unconditionally render a red border as we can't tell which rule might be rendered before and therefore appears first in the stylesheet. There might have been another rule that renders `borderColor: red` which is rendered before this rule. Now rendering this rule, would cause `border: 1px solid black` to always be preferred based on how CSS specificity works.

To solve this problem, you should not use shorthand and longhand properties together in a single rule. Perhaps the best is to avoid them at all. To give you an example, here's how you would write the above:

```javascript nocopy
const rule = (props) => ({
  borderStyle: 'solid',
  borderWidth: '1px',
  borderColor: 'red',
})
```

It might be more code to type, but its also more self-explanatory and descriptive.<br />

### propertyPriority & fela-enforce-longhands

Another option to solve this in a deterministic way is by utilizing the [propertyPriority config option](advanced/renderer-configuration) or using the [fela-enforce-longhands](https://github.com/robinweser/fela/tree/master/packages/fela-enforce-longhands) enhancer which implements an opinionated `propertyPriority` configuration.

## CSS properties that contain double quotes

For css properties that need double quotes, make sure you are using nested quotes in your code. e.g.:

```javascript nocopy
const rule = (props) => ({
  ':before': {
    content: '" "',
  },
})
```
